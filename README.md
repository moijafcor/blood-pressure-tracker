# blood-pressure-tracker
A "bare to the bones" app for logging blood pressure readings written in Python.

## Features

- A simple way to log blood pressure readings using your Terminal (This should simplify its integration with other tools like a Digital Assistant, etc. using just Bash piping).
- Readings are persisted in an Excel file at a path specified in the configuration file
- Plotting a chart with the reading values over time
- In-terminal rendering of data points in a table format
- Multi-lingual
- Interactive operation modes or passing in command arguments

## TODO

- Installer
- Google Sheets Integration

## Credits

I would like to acknowledge the helpful assistance of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. ChatGPT generated an initial draft of the main script and Copilot aided in writing documentation and other components, saving me time. 

I would also like to thank Claude, Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic, who assisted with proofreading this documentation and provided feedback to improve its clarity and completeness.  

ChatGPT prompts are included in the commit history to show the progression of the code over time based on prompting.
