# blood-pressure-tracker
A "bare to the bones" app for logging blood pressure readings writing in Python.

## Features

- A simple way to log blood pressure readings using your Terminal (This should simplify its integration to other tools like a Digital Assistant, etc. using just Bash piping ).
- Readings are persisted on an Excel file on a path specified on the configuration file
- Plotting a chart with the reading values over time
- In-terminal rendering of data points in a table format
- Multi-lingual
- Interactive operation modes or passing in command arguments

## TODO
- GUI
- Installer
- Google Sheets Integration

## Credits

I would like to acknowledge the apt assistance of ChatGPT and Github Copilot; the former for writing a draft of the main script and the latter for its help in writing documentation and other boring stuff.

ChatGPT prompts are included. A curious reader can just use the commits to time travel the code generated via prompting.
